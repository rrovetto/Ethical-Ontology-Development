## Background Concepts in Formal Ontology & Ontology Engineering

### Many Models / Theory -- Many starting assumptions

Formal ontology is an _abstract_ and _analytical_ branch of metaphysics that aims to characterize a topic area using logics in a highly generic, often domain-independent manner.

Both formal ontology and ontology engineering in computer and information science (e.g. in AI) often involve creating models, accounts, or theories. 

Because both (at least the former) are often analytical activities, their resultant models or theories may vary, but are typically started with some assumptions.
Those assumptions may be logical, metaphysical (philosophical ontology), or otherwise. 

**Therefore, you should always take any ontological model with a grain of salt. That is, there can be many.**
For example, mereology is the study of part and their wholes, using formal meethods such as logic and formal ontology. 
Each mereological account may begin with a different set of assumptions. Therefore there is no single theory of mereology, but more than one depending on first principles, etc. 

### Conceptual & Abstract Distinctions

The **Generic vs. Specific** distinction is a common, and perhaps fundamental, distinction used in many disciplines. It is ubiquitous in ontology. It stems from ancient philosophical inquiry, and has resulted in contemporary distinctions in mathematics, computer and information science such as:
class vs. member, 
set vs. element, 
category vs. individual
...
The readers is encouraged to look at Type theory and others to understand related formal concepts.
