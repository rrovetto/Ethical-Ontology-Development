# Ethics in Ontology Development
Research and development into ethical, moral and social considerations of various aspects of ontologies and ontology development.

## Goals
- A set of ethical principles for ontology development
- To correct [misinformation and myths](https://github.com/rrovetto/Ethical-Ontology-Development/blob/master/Myths-Of-Ontology-Development.md) of ontology development and use
- To increase moral awareness and responsibility in semantic-related communities
- To increase user awareness of the semantics and underlying viewpoints within ontologies they (users) may use
- To ensure fairness, equal opportunity among ontologies in the community. 

## Preliminary Points
- If ontologies are, in part, about stating the things presumed to exist, then you better be informed whether a given ontology is inclusive of what you, your data, or your organnization believes to exist. Be aware whether an ontology accepts, or miscategorizes/micharacterizes the things you want to include in an ontology. 
- Your mental model should not be forced under, or changed into, that of another ontology or it's developers, at least not without your consent.
