# Myths of Ontology Development & their Applications: 
**_Correcting Misinformation for Users and Developers of Ontologies_**

## 1. The Myth of Mappings / The Shallowness of Harmonization

**MYTH / FALSITY** :x:: mappings between terms, or harmonized ontologies, are always complete or true mappings.   

**TRUTH** :white_check_mark:: There are degrees of mappings / degrees of semantic harmoniztion. Mappings may not be correct or complete.
- A mapping or harmonization between two terms, two vocabularies, or two ontologies is only a complete and true mapping/harmonization if all degrees or levels of abstract and commitments are examined for compatibility between the two ontologies.
- *Mappings may be false, incorrect, or partial* if the intended meaning of the mapped entities is not examined and compared. A mapping that only looks at the character string or the phrasing of the term is a **shallow mapping**. It is an **incomplete mapping** if the terms are defined with other more abstract terms or if they have commitments (e.g., via subsuming or parent category terms). 
- *Degrees of mapping/harmonization:* there can be exact mapping, partial mapping, no mapping, etc.
  - Analogy of the Shallowness of Mappings/Harmonization: 
    - dipping your tow in a lake is like declaring two leaf ontology terms are semantically equivalent (have the same meaning).
    - putting your foot in the like is like declaring semantically equivalent the immediately more abstract superordinate or subsuming terms.
    - ...and so on.
- *Compare the intended meaning and formal logical semantics of the two target terms/concepts that potentially map to one another.* 
All commitments, at each degree of abstraction, of each of the two target concepts, terms, symbol-structures or ontologies to be mapped (or semantically harmonizaed) need to examined and compared. E.g., you need to understand the intended meaning and formal logical semantics of the ground (or most specific leaf term) is, and whether or to what extent it's the same as the other term it potentially maps to.  

NOTE: 'mapping' or 'semantic harmonization' here means the activity of identifying equivalence in intended meaning between two symbol structures (e.g., a term in an ontology, a class with a term label, etc.). 'semantic compatibility' means two ontologies or two concepts/terms/symbol-structures 

## 2. The Myth of Upper-level or Top-level ontology Use or Re-use.
**MYTH / FALSITY**:x:: you should use an existing upper- or top-level ontology (also called foundational, core, or generic ontology).

**TRUTH** :white_check_mark:: 
- (A) you **do not** need an upper- or top-level ontology. The same results or benefits purported by supporters of uppper ontolgoies can be achieved through other means. And the myth is often used as a strategy for self-gain by those upper groups to acquire more users and thereby more $ potntial. 
- (B) you **can** create your own upper or top-level ontology. NOTE: This is encouraged to foster diversity, creativity, innovation in the communtiy, and to ensure ethical practice by helping prevent the monopolization and unfair advantage of any single existing top-level ontology. 
- (C) Re-use is often used as a selfish strategy to justify using a particular ontology product. In reality, re-use dependts on the situation: the project and it's specifics; SOmetimes re-use is helpful, but not always. 

## 3. The Myth of Ontology Re-use (in general)
**Myth / Falsity**:x:: you should re-use existing ontologies.

**TRUTH**:white_check_mark:: *You do not need to, but it may be helpful sometimes. You can create and be innovative!*
If you consider re-using other ontologies, you should excersie your right to be infored about the intended meaning, formal semantics, assumptions, and commitments the candidate ontology makes. Exercise due diligence so that you do not commit yourself to a worldview that you don't agree with or that may exclude the entities, content, or knowledge of your expertise and discipline.

With regard to #2, this is partly why it is important to understand the assumptions and meaning of the most abstract ontology models--because some assumpt philosophical theories that may exclude or mischaracterize things you may want in your own model. For example, some ontologies will deny the exist, or miscategorize, things like mind, truth, God, etc. Some may assume a philosophical theory about activities or processes (very broadly concieved) you do not agree with, or that conflics with what your data or domain knowledge may suggest. *This is one reason to make your own ontology and your top-level ontology* (if you decide you want a most abstract semantic layer).

## 4. The Myth of Reinventign the Wheel.

**Myth / Falsity**:x:: Do not re-invent the wheel; reuse existing ontologies.

**TRUTH**:white_check_mark:: *You do not need to, but it may be helpful sometimes. You can create and be innovative!*

- That myth is often expressed in various disciplines, and often to the advantage of some who wish to gain users/custoers of their work/product. 
It is often used to justify--incorrectly so--the use of a single product or resource; and hence is often abused by using it as a strategy to get one's ontology or product to be used, adopted, or bought (i.e. unethical). 

- Re-use is more easily done with tools that are agnostic as to semantics, knowledge, etc. BUT, for knowledge organization systems and semantic resources such as ontologies or classification systems, there is an ethical aspect that we all must consider because here we are dealing with meaning about our concepts and sometimes very profound and important topics of humanity. We have an moral responsibility to not simply re-use without knowing the intended meaning, assumped worldviews, and commitments made by semantic models like ontologies, metadata sets, vocabularies, etc.
