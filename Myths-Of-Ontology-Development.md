# Myths of Ontology Development & their Applications: 
**_Correcting Misinformation for Users and Developers of Ontologies_**

## 1. The Myth of Mappings / The Shallowness of Harmonization

**MYTH / FALSITY** :x:: mappings between terms, or harmonized ontologies, are always complete or true mappings.   

**TRUTH** :white_check_mark:: There are degrees of mappings / degrees of semantic harmoniztion. Mappings may not be correct or complete.
- A mapping or harmonization between two terms, two vocabularies, or two ontologies is only a complete and true mapping if all degrees or levels of abstraction, subsumption and commitments are examined for semantic equivalence between the two ontologies. (e.g. a parent term in one ontology may not be intended in another).
- *Alleged mappings may be false, incorrect, or partial* if the intended meaning of the mapped entities is not examined and compared. A string match is not enough.
  - A mapping that only looks at the character string or the phrasing of the term is a **shallow mapping** and incomplete. It is an **incomplete mapping** if the terms are defined using other (perhaps more abstract) terms or if they have commitments or constraints (e.g., via subsuming or parent category terms). So these aspects must be understood when doing mappings. 
- **Degrees of mapping/harmonization:** there can be _exact mapping_, _partial mapping_, _no mapping_, etc.
  - Analogy of the Shallowness of Mappings/Harmonization: 
    - dipping your toe in a lake is like declaring two leaf terms are semantically equivalent (have the same meaning).
    - putting your foot in the like is like declaring the two leaf terms with their immediate parent (more abstract/superordinate/subsuming) terms are semantically equivalent.
    - ...and so on depending on how deep or abstract the nesting goes. 
- *Compare the intended meaning and formal logical semantics of the two target terms/concepts that potentially map to one another.* 
All commitments, at each degree of abstraction, of each of the two target concepts, terms, symbol-structures or ontologies to be mapped (or semantically harmonizaed) need to examined and compared. E.g., you need to understand the intended meaning and formal logical semantics of the ground (or most specific leaf term) is, and whether or to what extent it's the same as the other term it potentially maps to.  

NOTE: 'mapping' or 'semantic harmonization' here means the activity of identifying equivalence in intended meaning between two symbol structures (e.g., a term in an ontology, a class with a term label, etc.). 'semantic compatibility' means two ontologies or two concepts/terms/symbol-structures 

## 2. The Myth of Upper-level or Top-level ontology Use or Re-use.
**MYTH / FALSITY**:x:: you should use an existing upper- or top-level ontology (also called foundational, core, or generic ontology).

**TRUTH** :white_check_mark:: 
- (A) you **do not** need an upper- or top-level ontology. The same results or benefits purported by supporters of uppper ontolgoies can be achieved through other means. And the myth is often used as a strategy for self-gain by those upper groups to acquire more users and thereby more $ potntial. 
- (B) you **can** create your own upper or top-level ontology. NOTE: This is encouraged to foster diversity, creativity, innovation in the communtiy, and to ensure ethical practice by helping prevent the monopolization and unfair advantage of any single existing top-level ontology. 
- (C) Re-use is often used as a selfish strategy to justify using a particular ontology product. In reality, re-use dependts on the situation: the project and it's specifics; SOmetimes re-use is helpful, but not always. 

## 3. The Myth of Ontology Re-use (in general)
**Myth / Falsity**:x:: you should re-use existing ontologies.

**TRUTH**:white_check_mark:: *You do not need to, but it may be helpful sometimes. You can create and be innovative!*
If you consider re-using other ontologies, you should excersie your right to be infored about the intended meaning, formal semantics, assumptions, and commitments the candidate ontology makes. Exercise due diligence so that you do not commit yourself to a worldview that you don't agree with or that may exclude the entities, content, or knowledge of your expertise and discipline.

With regard to #2, this is partly why it is important to understand the assumptions and meaning of the most abstract ontology models--because some assumpt philosophical theories that may exclude or mischaracterize things you may want in your own model. For example, some ontologies will deny the exist, or miscategorize, things like mind, truth, God, etc. Some may assume a philosophical theory about activities or processes (very broadly concieved) you do not agree with, or that conflics with what your data or domain knowledge may suggest. *This is one reason to make your own ontology and your top-level ontology* (if you decide you want a most abstract semantic layer).

## 4. The Myth of Reinventign the Wheel.

**Myth / Falsity**:x:: Do not re-invent the wheel (reuse existing ontologies).

**TRUTH**:white_check_mark:: **You do not need to, but it may be helpful sometimes. You can create and be innovative!**
- There are ways to achieve interoperability besides re-use.
- That myth is expressed in various disciplines, often to the advantage of a few who wish to gain users or custoers of their product. It is often used to justify--incorrectly so--the use of a single product or resource, to the disadvantage of other (perhaps competing products). It's abused as a unethical strategy to get one's ontology adopted or used. 

- **Tool Re-use vs. Semantic Re-use.**  
  - Re-use is more easily done with tools that are _agnostic_ as to semantics, knowledge, etc. 
  - BUT, knowledge organization systems and semantic resources such as ontologies are not agnostic: they are inherently about meaning/semantics/knowlege. Some of it may be about profound, sensitive or unanswered concepts of humanity. And therefore there is an ethical aspect and responsibiity to it. Re-use depends on whether that meaning matches yours (or your data), or whether it is correct/accurate/acceptable/etc.  We have an moral responsibility to not simply re-use without knowing the intended meaning, assumped worldviews, and commitments made by semantic models like ontologies, metadata sets, vocabularies, etc. You have a right to be aware and be informed, regardless of the degree of abstraction.
