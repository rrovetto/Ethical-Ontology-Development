# Myths of Ontology Development & their Applications

## 1. The Myth of Mappings / The Shallowness of Harmonization

**Myth / Falsity**: mappings are always complete or true mappings. Harmonized ontologies or vocabularies are always complete or true harmonizations.

**Truth**: There is degrees of mappings / degrees of Semantic Harmoniztion. 
- A mapping or harmonization between two ontologies is only a complete and true mapping/harmonization if all degrees or levels of abstract and commitments are examined for compatibility between the two ontologies.
- *Degrees of mapping/harmonization:* there can be exact mapping, partial mapping, no mapping, etc.
- *Compare the intended meaning and formal logical semantics of the two target terms/concepts that potentially map to one another.* 
All commitments, at each degree of abstraction, of each of the two target concepts, terms, symbol-structures or ontologies to be mapped (or semantically harmonizaed) need to examined and compared. E.g., you need to understand the intended meaning and formal logical semantics of the ground (or most specific leaf term) is, and whether or to what extent it's the same as the other term it potentially maps to.  

NOTE: 'mapping' or 'semantic harmonization' here means the activity of identifying equivalence in intended meaning between two symbol structures (e.g., a term in an ontology, a class with a term label, etc.). 'semantic compatibility' means two ontologies or two concepts/terms/symbol-structures 

## 2. The Myth of Upper-level or Top-level ontology Use or Re-use.
**Myth / Falsity**: you should use an existing top-level ontology (also called upper-level, foundational, core ontology).
**Truth**: 
- (A) you **do not** need upper- or top-level ontology. The same results or benefits purported by supporters of uppper ontolgoies can be achieved through other means. And the myth is often used as a strategy for self-gain by those upper groups to acquire more users and thereby more $ potntial.
- (B) you **can** create your own upper or top-level ontology. NOTE: This is encouraged to foster diversity, creativity, innovation in the communtiy, and to ensure ethical practice by helping prevent the monopolization and unfair advantage of any single existing top-level ontology.
- (C) Re-use is often used as a selfish strategy to justify using a particular ontology product. In reality, re-use dependts on the situation: the project and it's specifics; SOmetimes re-use is helpful, but not always.
